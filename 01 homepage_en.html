        <p>Welcome to the official website dedicated to the preservation and documentation of the <strong>Lamo
            language</strong>, an unwritten, undocumented and undescribed endangered language spoken in Chamdo
        (ཆབ་མདོ་གྲོང་ཁྱེར, 昌都市, chāngdū), located in the eastern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region, China. This website
        is a partial outcome of my PhD project, titled <strong><i>The documentation and the description of the
                Lamo language: Preserving linguitic and cultural diversity in Eastern Tibet</i></strong>,
        supervised by Professor <a href="http://katia-chirkova.info/" target="_blank">Ekaterina (Katia)
            CHIRKOVA</a>. The purpose of this project is to capture and share the linguistic and cultural richness
        of this unique language, ensuring its survival for future generations.</p>

            <h2>Current status of Lamo</h2>
            <p>Lamo is one of only four <b>non-Tibetic Tibeto-Burman</b> languages spoken in Chamdo, Tibet,
                China. It presents a unique linguistic case because of its mysterious Qiangic origin and undetermined
                genealogical affiliation. The urgency for documentation arises from its critical endangerment, unwritten
                status, and previous lack of documentation. </p>
            <p>With approximately 3,000 fluent speakers, Lamo faces significant intergenerational interruption due to
                <b>urbanization</b> and the <b>influence of prestige languages</b>, such as Kham
                Tibetan and Mandarin Chinese. Most children are unable to speak or understand it, leading to a 23% decline
                in the number of native speakers over four years.
            </p>
            <p>It is crucial to document and revitalize this language before it is lost forever.</p>

            <h2>Project goals</h2>
            <p>This project aims to provide the first-ever <b>comprehensive description</b> of Lamo and to create an
                <b>open-access database</b>, including audio or video recordings of a <a href="#">vocabulary list</a>,
                <a href="#">narratives</a>, and <a href="#">conversations</a>, aligned with IPA transcription, morpho-syntactic annotations, and translations in English, French, Mandarin Chinese, and Standard Tibetan.
            </p>
            <p>Data collected through fieldwork will be compiled into marked-up text, facilitating phonetic and phonological analysis, examination of word categories, and phrasal and sentence structures from the perspective of functional typology. The project will also employ quantitative and qualitative linguistic comparison with adjacent languages, contributing to the studies of Himalayan languages, such as evidentiality, and the studies of contact-induced language change.</p>

        <section class="content">
            <h2>Language in the danger of disappearing</h2>
            <p>The population of Lamo speakers is approximately 3500 individuals residing in Dongba and Zhonglinka Town, 2000 in Dobbar, and 1500 in Zhonglinka, according to data from Nyima & Suzuki (2019, p.45-46).</p>
            <p>The population of Lamo speakers is declining due to factors such as migration, the implementation of Mandarin Chinese, and Chinese government initiatives targeting poverty alleviation and urbanization policies. Although the current situation of the Lamei variety is unclear, the population of the Lamo dialect has decreased by 23% over the past four years.</p>
            <p>Currently, fluent speakers of the Lamo language are generally over 30 years old, and the language is used within the local community. Most young adults move to Chamdo or other cities such as Lhasa or Chengdu in search of better-paying job opportunities. For some, this move also coincides with marriage, as they often settle in the cities where they find employment. Regarding the younger generation, they tend to use Tibetan and Chinese languages. During my visit to Dobbar, I did not encounter any children who could speak the local language, and some did not even respond to hearing basic words. The language is not transmitted through the educational system or community institutions. Therefore, according to EGIDS (Lewis & Simons, 2010), the Lamo language can be classified at level 7, "shifting".</p>
